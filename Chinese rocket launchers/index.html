            China successfully launched its most powerful rocket, the hulking Long March-5B, on its maiden voyage into orbit on May 5. The 176-foot-long rocket—designed to shuttle astronauts to low-Earth orbit or even around the moon—blasted off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan at 18:00 local time.

            According to state-run media, the rocket is powered by a pair of hydrogen-fueled YF-77 core stage engines and eight kerosene-fueled booster engines and can haul up a 55,000-pound payload into orbit with almost 2.4 million pounds of thrust. By comparison, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets each provide about 1.7 million pounds of thrust at lift-off and slightly more in space.

                The successful launch of Long March-5B paves a path for China to explore further into our solar system.Before the end of the year, the Long March-5 is scheduled to launch China's first Mars probe and the Chang'e-5 lunar probe to collect moon samples and return to Earth, according to Xinhua.

            Now, China is planning to launch a permanent space station by 2022, and there has even been talk of becoming just the second nation to send a person to the surface of the moon, possibly in the 2030s.</p>

                China’s deep-space human spaceflight ambitions are clear, but its next steps have not yet been announced. Chinese officials have discussed sending humans to the Moon in the 2030s, but a lot more hardware needs to be built for that to happen, notably a lunar lander and potentially a new rocket to take humans to deep space, says Jones. “The Moon missions — they have plans,” he says. “We can see from this mission today that they’re really thinking about it and working towards it, but there’s still lots to be decided."

        <blockquote>Today’s flight does signal that China is serious about sending its astronauts beyond Earth orbit. “They’ve made themselves a part of the conversation about what humanity is going to do in terms of deep space exploration going forward,” says Jones.</blockquote>
